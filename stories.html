            <h3 class="h1">Life Story From John</h3>
            <p class="p2"><strong>A man named Tom started a chain of kindness by paying for the person's meal behind him in line at a coffee shop.
                 The person behind him then paid for the meal of the person behind them, and so on. 
                 The chain of kindness continued for several weeks, with people paying it forward to strangers all over the city.

            <p class="p3"><strong>A homeless veteran in Florida used his last $20 to buy gas for a stranded motorist. 
                The motorist was so moved by the veteran's kindness that she started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for him, 
                which ended up raising over $400,000.

            <p class="p4"><strong>A group of students in Canada started a project called "warm hands" to help the homeless in their community. 
                They made and distributed hand warmers to people living on the streets, as well as hats, scarves, and other warm items. 
                The project was a small act of kindness that made a big difference in the lives of those who received it.
